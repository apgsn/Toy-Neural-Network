# Toy-Neural-Network
A neural network built from scratch in C++

A standard neural network implemented in C++11. There are two main files where you can experiment with variables:
- main XOR: solves the XOR problem
- main MNIST: gets trained against MNIST and lets you check the accuracy against the training set. Alternatively, you can choose to open a graphic window (SFML dependency) and use you mouse to draw a number, you'll see the neural network try to guess in real time.
